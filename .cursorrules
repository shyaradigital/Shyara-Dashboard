# Shyara Dashboard Development Rules

## Project Structure
- This is a modular Next.js 14+ application using TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ShadCN UI
- Keep all features modular - each major feature should live in its own folder under `features/`
- Each major feature should be built in a separate chat session
- Follow the existing patterns for components, hooks, stores, and utilities

## Feature Development
- **Modularity**: Each feature gets its own folder in `features/` (e.g., `features/invoices/`, `features/finances/`)
- **Self-contained**: Features should include their own components, hooks, types, and utilities
- **Shared code**: Use `features/_shared/` for utilities shared across multiple features
- **Reusability**: Place truly reusable components in `components/ui/` or `components/layout/`

## Code Organization
- **Components**: 
  - `components/ui/` - ShadCN UI components and base components
  - `components/layout/` - Layout components (Sidebar, Topbar, etc.)
  - `features/[feature]/components/` - Feature-specific components
  
- **State Management**:
  - Use Zustand for global state (auth, app-wide settings)
  - Feature-specific state can use Zustand stores in `features/[feature]/store/`
  
- **Hooks**: 
  - Global hooks in `hooks/`
  - Feature-specific hooks in `features/[feature]/hooks/`
  
- **Types**: 
  - Global types in `types/`
  - Feature-specific types in `features/[feature]/types/`

## Role-Based Access Control
- Always check permissions using `useAuth().checkPermission(permission)`
- Use role constants from `lib/constants.ts`
- Hide UI elements based on permissions, not just routes

## Styling
- Use TailwindCSS utility classes
- Primary brand color is purple (configured in `tailwind.config.ts`)
- Use ShadCN UI components as base, customize as needed
- Ensure responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop

## Code Quality
- Follow TypeScript strict mode
- Use ESLint and Prettier (configured)
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Add proper TypeScript types for all functions and components

## Next Steps
- When building new features, create a new chat session
- Reference this file and existing code patterns
- Keep features independent and modular
